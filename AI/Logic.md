##Propositional Logic

## About

Branch of logic that studies the ways of joining entire propositions, statements or sentences to form more complicated propositions, statements or sentences. 

The simplest statements are **indivisible units** and hence propositional logic does not study these logical properties and relations that depends on these statements. 

## First Order Logic

### About

Symbolized reasoning in which each sentence or statement is broken into a subject and a predictate. 
The predicate modifies or defines the properties of the subject. In FOL, a predicate only refers to a single subject. FOL is known as first order predicte calculus. 

There exist quantifiers to help define first order logic statements, as well as operators.
