# Behaviour Questions
Why do you want to work at Google?
 - Google is a successful company.
 - Learn what makes these companies successful (from a technical perspective) and how they work.
     -If you donâ€™t see early on what structure does look like - it will be hard to set goals later on.
 - Technically challenging, and I think it would be nice to understand how engineering teams work in a company as large as google.

# Tell me about yourself
I like coding and thinking logically. I actually came from a research orientated background.
I like both the idea of pushing the boundaries of what I know, and I also like making things.

I started to realise I like forming actual real ideas into code, more than I like the research ideas.

In my spare time, I read books, exercise.


# Iterator for tree

# Prefix sum

P = [0]
for x in A:
    P.append(P[-1] + x)

# Binary search (Duplicates)

					index = mid
					break
			elif target > nums[mid]:
					low = mid + 1
