# Tips
## General
Ensuring that two values are 1 away from each other
abs(m-n)

if list is used at any time, always ask what happens if list is:
  1. Empty/Size 1
  2. Is increasing/decreasing continuously

In jump game, bounds are quickly surpassed when n=37. Nice to talk about possible integer bounds being surpassed. Python3.7 does not have a bound on its integer. 

Think about the best case time complexity possible given the description of the problem.

Don't forget about sorting

Steps:
1. Give a higher level idea of the solution
2. Give the expected time complexity
## Arrays and Strings
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array

Algorithms to consider:
KMP

ASCII character set is 128 characters

If you have to modify something inplace, try doing it from the back
Lists also support slicing assignment.

A[1:3] = "Ab"


!! When handling strings, remember that there exist upper case and lower case, and sometimes they are case insensitive

Nifty trick:
return min(string, ''.join(compressed), key=len)

Check if 1 substring is a subset of the other substring


Generating prefix arrays:
B = [0] * (N+1)
for i in range(N):
  B[i+1] = B[i] + A[i]


Good tips on monotonic queues:

## LinkedList
Always check if you are removing from the start of the linkedlist (requires reassignment of head ptr)
Consider padding linkedlist with nodes infront (consider ctci sum lists, common ancestor)

Common ancestor of linkedlist and trees are similar


## Backtracking
Be clear that its adding the piece at this position, checking if it works, and continue (in-place, so your helpers should not return the board but continue modifying the same board)

!! Backtracking should be done in-place

## Binary Search
Binary search appears in funny places. If there is a bounds on the domains to search, try binary searching the value and applying some form of verifying algorithm


## Graph 
If need to do BFS, use a deque()
Ask if there are duplicates (!) esp. in bst

Preorder traversal of trees are not unique, but preorder traversal of trees where the None nodes are marked with a special character are unique


## Useful Problems:

Reaching Points - work from the back instead of the front
