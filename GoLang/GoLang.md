# GoLang

## Basic Syntax Ideas

1. Uses tokens. There are four classes: identifiers, keywords, operators, punctutation, and literals. 
2. Uses semicolons as terminators. However, Go programs may omit these semicolons following some rules. 
3. Common types: ArrayType, StructType, PointerType, FunctionType, SliceType, MapType, ChannelType

4. Initialization of variables 
- Types are declared after the variable. 
- Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued. 
- Either var <name> or <name> := can be used to initialize variables


## Packages

The first statement in a Go source file must be:

```
package name
```


## Miscellaneous Ideas
- GoLang supports anonymous functions, which can form closures.
