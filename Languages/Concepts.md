# Programming Languages

## Motivations of PLs

1. Novel ways of expressing computation

2. Better execution model

3. Better reliability


## General notes:

1. With laziness infinite functions can be created

2. Algebraic data types ?


## Types

### Sum and Product Types

Product Types: Combine multiple types using an "and"

Sum Types: Combined multiple types using an "or"

Use of product types is similar to the use of strcuts. But the use of product types leads to a strong top-down design pattern. 

Sum types allow similarity between types without the same bloated code.

In Haskell, Product types include tuples and records. Sum types includes ordinals and general data types.
