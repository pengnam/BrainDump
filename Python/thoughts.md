# Thoughts

## Ways of thinking about python


1) Data Model

"dunder methods" or data model methods

top level syntax have corresponding data model methods


2) 
Adding an assert at the start of the module to make sure that methods exist. Derived class enforce a constraint on the base class.

try-catch only appears on run-time, so its a bad idea


Every statement is an executable piece of code


2) Protocol orientated language




## Miscellaneous

Python is pass by assignment
