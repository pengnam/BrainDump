# Meditations
## By Marcus Arelius

Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked around by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.

What is divine is full of providence. Even chance is not devolved from nature. 

Concentrate every minute like a man on doing what is infront of you with precise and genuine seriousness. 

## On other people

Don't waste the rest of your time worrying about other people unless it affects the commonn good. 

## On how to act

Never act under compulsion, out of selfishness, or without forethought. 

Look at how we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. 

Be straightforward, act without pretension.

## 

You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. 

Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving?
