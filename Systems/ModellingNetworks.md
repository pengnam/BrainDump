# Modelling Networks


Interevent time modelling by exponential distribution. 
The number of arrivals is modelled by a poisson distribution.m

## Poisson Process (Exponential inter-arrival time)

1. Memoryless property

- distribution of a "waiting time" until a certain event does not depend on how much time has elapsed.

P(X > m + n | X >= m) = P(X > n)

2. Merging property

-consider two flows, one with rate lambda_1 and another with rate lambda_2.

- forms a new flow with lambda = lambda_1 + lambda_2
