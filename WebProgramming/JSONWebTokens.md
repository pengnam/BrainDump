#JSON Web Tokens

JSON Web Tokens is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way
for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.


## Structure
JSON Web Tokens are three parts separated by dots (`.`), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

## Alternatives
1. Simple Web Tokens (SWT)
2. Security Assertion Markup Language Tokens (SAML)


JWT can use public/private key pay for signing, more compact than XML.

JSON parsers typically map directly to objects in most languages.
