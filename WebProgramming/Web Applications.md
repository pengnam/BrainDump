# Web Applications

## Types
1. Multi page Application
2. Single page Application

## MPA

Traditional web application that reloads the entire page and displays a new one when user interacts with the web app.
Each time data is exchanged back and forth, a new page is requested to display in browser.

AJAX made it possible to render just a component of the application.
Typically more complex.

## SPA
Consists of a single page, single sharing link.

Less secure due to cross-site scripting.

Easier to deploy
