# Work

I feel that it is important to take stock of what I want and do not want in full-time work for me to get a sense of what the best decision for myself is.

Making better decisions might pay off more than anything else I do at this point. The choice of a future career is important and I wish to take some stock to understand the implications.

This page serves as a personal checklist.

## Checklist of personal principles

- I am currently optimising for personal growth. This means that: my current job should provide opportunities for me to work on things that directly interest me or give me room to do that.

- I should build a career moat. This means that I should build a set of skills that is competitive and not constantly putting me at risk to losing a job.

- I should optimise for time. Time is the only real currency.

- I should be wary about over-optimising. There isn't a real distinct reason to choose a job over another.

- I should talk to people that are experienced and whose opinions I respect.

- (\*) The goal is and always is about finding the right team.
