# From Army to Software Engineering

```
I felt that the army took two years of my life and it was important that I pen down my thoughts in a bid to form a more cohesive narrative of my journey.

As with all 16 year olds in Singapore, the start of Junior College indiciated that the Army was approaching. 

Back then, I approached the idea of army with a strong enthusiasm. The army felt like a natural progression of what I was doing: I was really active as a student councillor and was also in track and field. Army felt 'real'; I felt disenchanted with JC education, and was really motivated in group situations. 

Towards the end of year 1 in JC, I was given the PES status of C. I have a benign heart condition and a permanent back injury. I sort of expected it and in some ways it felt that my army journey ended before it even started. 

Fast forward to the Army; I enlisted in the PES C basic military training, which was where the non-combat fit personel underwent training. The group of us was a funny bunch: there were two kinds of people. There were those that were fit and those who just had medical conditions. I think that was actually the start of the diversity of people that I met with in the army. 

The lack of physical training made training difficult and not difficult at the same time. It wasn't difficult because it wasn't physically tiring but the lack of physical training made making connections between people difficult.

The head of manpower took a chance with me and asked me to be a commanding officer's personal assistant. I always remember the moment because that had a large impact on my experience. 

## Purpose

The large part of training was very hypothetical. The military is a large institution and many walked out of it with a positive experience. But for a clerk, knowing that there is very little that will actually be applied is draining. Draining because I felt that there could have been greater purpose in the work that I did.

I helped planned transport for a national event: pulling 12h shifts at Changi Airport (~1.5h travelling time) 7 days a week was fun. Back then I was still dating Nat so that month was difficult. I felt a strong sense of camaraderie that I did not find in my basic military training.

Planning smaller events, managing my boss's schedule, trying to take classes on the side. I think most of the things that I tried to do then were very undirected. Undirected because I felt that I could have spent more time working on more productive things if I knew the direction that I was heading towards but I didn't. 

Back then I realised that it was best to have a good understanding of a single thing rather than cursory knowledge of many things. 

# Moving on
Suddenly, I was a civillian again. In the civilian world there is no rank, and it felt that I had to constantly prove my worth all over again. 

I struggled practically and emotionally. Emotianally, I struggled to find meaning. Army was an excuse that I could give to be unproductive but now I could not do the same. There were also times when there could be several
