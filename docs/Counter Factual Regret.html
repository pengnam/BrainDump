<h2>Defining key ideas</h2>

<p>Regret:
-at a time t, is a different between our algorithm total loss and the best single expert loss.
-expresses how much we regret for not following the single best advice.</p>

<p>$$ R = L<em>{H}^{T} - min</em>{i}(L_{i}^{t})$$</p>

<p>An online algorithm H learns without regret if in the limit as T goes into infinity, its <strong>average</strong> regret goes to zero in the worst case. Meaning no single expert is better than H in the limit its average regret goes to zero in the worst case - no single expert better than H in the limit.</p>

<p>Average regret is the cumulative regret divided by time steps.</p>

<p>Information sets: players perspective of game state (i.e. my cards + opp cards + community cards)</p>

<h2>No regret learning</h2>

<p>Repeatedly making decision in an uncertain environment. Receive advice from N experts about a single phenomenon. Our online algorithm H&rsquo;s goal is to distribute trust among experts.</p>

<p>After outcome is revealed, there is a loss vector that evaluates the N experts.</p>

<h2>Counter factual regret minimisation</h2>

<p>Optimises entity called immediate counterfactual regret, which is an upper bound on average overall regret.</p>

<p>Guaranteed to go to zero in the limit if regret matching is applied.</p>

<h3>Counter factual utility</h3>

<p>$$ \sum_{h&rsquo; part of Z} \pi^{\sigma} (h, h&rsquo;)u(h&rsquo;)$$</p>

<p>Z is the set of all terminal nodes</p>

<p>If this is considered for every possible game state (every possible opponent&rsquo;s hand), we will end up with a vector of utilities, one for each hand.</p>

<p>For counterfactual utility, another weighting scheme is used. The probability of reaching h, assuming that we wanted to get to h is used instead.</p>

<p>Instead of using the regular strategy from strategy profile,</p>

<h2>Memory Requirements</h2>

<p>Distinguish: reward for playing action a at time t
Every action will be rewarded via unnormalized counter factual utility assuming action was played.</p>
