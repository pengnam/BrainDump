<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A technique that has one object supplying the dependencies of another object.</p>

<p>Allows for a <em>seperation of concern</em> between the construction and the use of objects.</p>

<p>Allows programs to be loosly coupled.</p>

<h2>Types of Dependency Injection</h2>

<h3>Constructor Injection</h3>

<p>Constructor is used to decide an object&rsquo;s dependencies. Object declares in constructor the objects that it needs.
Register constructor (and relevant parameters) into the provider.</p>

<h3>Setter Injection</h3>

<p>Defining setter methods in objects that need injection.</p>

<h3>Interface Injection</h3>

<p>An interface can be used to perform the injection through.</p>

<h2>Alternative: Service locator</h2>

<p>Object calls service locator object to find its dependencies.</p>

<p>This, however, creates a dependency between the service locator and the object.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>There seems to be different ways of registering a provider.</p>

<p>One way would be to register with a configuration file, another one is by calling methods. I believe both methods are similar.</p>

<h2>Service Locator vs Dependency Injection</h2>

<h3>Similarties:</h3>

<p>Both allow fundamental decoupling that&rsquo;s missing in the naive example.</p>

<p>Both gives inversion of control, but it comes at a price. It is potentially hard to understand and it leads to potential problems.</p>

<p>About equally difficult to test. Dependency injection will be easier with IDE support to search up references.</p>

<h3>Differences:</h3>

<pre><code>So the primary issue is for people who are writing code that expects to be used in applications outside of the control of the writer. In these cases even a minimal assumption about a Service Locator is a problem.
</code></pre>

<h2>Constructor vs Setter Injection</h2>

<p>The choice between setter and constructor injection is interesting as it mirrors a more general issue with object-oriented programming - should you fill fields in a constructor or with setters.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler&rsquo;s principle is that as much as possible create valid objects at run time. Constructors with parameters give a clear statement of what it means to create a valid object.</p>
