<h1>Characteristics of Design</h1>

<ol>
<li>Discoverability</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether the user is able to figure out what actions are possible.</p>

<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this all mean and what is the product supposed to do. I believe it to be a form of mental model about the user and the machine.</p>

<h1>Human Centered Design (HCD)</h1>

<p>HCD means to start with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. The understanding comes primarily through observation, for people themselves are unaware of their true needs.</p>

<p>Focus on <em>not just when the cases go right</em> but also when the <em>cases go wrong</em>.</p>

<h1>Fundamental Principles of Interaction</h1>

<p>Experience is strongly determined by the quality of interaction. It is critical for it affects the how the product is perceived.</p>

<h2>Affordances</h2>

<p>An affordance is a <em>relationship between a physical object and its product</em>: the abilities of the user and the properties of an object allows for a use case.</p>

<p>There are perceivable and unperceivable affordances.</p>

<p>Example: the structure of a chair and the shape of a person allows for sitting.</p>

<h2>Signifier</h2>

<p>Signifiers <em>communicate what action should take place</em>.</p>

<p>Difference from affordance is that signifiers indicate where the actions are possible, but affordance is about what actions are possible.</p>

<p>Example: Bookmark indicates page in book</p>

<h2>Mapping</h2>

<p>Relationship between two sets of things.</p>

<p>Natural mapping leads to immediate understanding. An example of natural mapping is spacial configuration.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Feedback must be immediate and descriptive. There should also be a limited amount of feedback.</p>

<p>Feedback has to be planned. <em>All actions need to be confirmed, ideally in an unobtrusive manner if its not important</em>.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Models</h2>

<p>A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, about how something works. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be complete or accurate, it just has to be useful.
<em>Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support them hold true.</em></p>

<p>These models should match.</p>

<h1>Psychology of everyday actions</h1>

<p>All three levels of processing work together. All play essential roles in determining a personâ€™s like or dislike of a product or service.</p>

<h2>Cognition vs emotion</h2>

<p>Dan Norman raises a question about whether cognition happens first or whether emotion happens first.</p>

<p>He believes that they are intertwined. Emotion affects how we retrospectively think about things. Cognition affects our feelings about a product.</p>

<h2>Design questions that users should answer</h2>
