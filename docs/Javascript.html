<p>Content was largely take from &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know JS&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Pillars</h2>

<h3>Scope and Closure</h3>

<p>Organization of variables into units of scope is one of the most foundational characteristics of any language.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lexically scoped variables (Static, deduced at compile time)</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope unit boundaries is determined at the time the program is parsed. Author time descision.
Variables at that level of scope nesting are accessible, variables outside are not.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Hoisting</em>: All variables declared anywhere in scope are treated as they are declared at the beginning og the scope.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>var</strong>: Declared variables are function scoped even if they appear inside a block.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>

<p>Prototypal inheritance was initially used to implement the class design pattern.</p>

<p>However, after <code>class</code> came in ES6, language doubled down on its inclination to OO.</p>

<p>But behaviour delegation is still important for organising behaviour and data in the program.</p>

<h3>Types and Coercision</h3>

<p>Not just solved with type aware tooling.</p>
