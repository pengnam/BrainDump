<p>Data structure makes it attractive for providing indexed access to files with high insert volume, such as transactional log data. LSM keeps data is two or more separate structures.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Two tree like structures: C0, C1, C0 in memory and smaller, C1 in disk. New records are inserted into C0. Once C0 is too large, merged with C1 on disk. Migrated to disk in a merge-sort like way.</p>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>New write added to an in-memory sorted balanced tree (known as memtable)</p></li>

<li><p>When memtable is too big, it is flushed to disk as an SSTable file. SSTable is a sorted key-value storage on disk of the in-memory tree.</p></li>

<li><p>Reads are directed to memtable. If keys are not found in memtable, it is searched and most recent SSTable is retrieved.</p></li>

<li><p>Duplicate key removed from SSTable and most recent is retained (compaction). Compacted SSTable are merged into new SSTable (merge sort -esque algorithm)</p></li>
</ol>
