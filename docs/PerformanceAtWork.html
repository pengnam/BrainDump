<p>the last few weeks I have been experiencing some mild problems at work. I have been paired with another software engineer to work on a task that she has been working for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>So today, I realised that I gave wrong facts at a meeting.</p>

<p>I feel uncomfortable because I believe that we are constantly being evaluated at work. Giving wrong facts, or answering wrongly to a question is a sign of poor concentration or understanding.</p>

<p>At the same time, I realised that it is unlikely that this will be the first mistake that I am going to make. In some ways, I have to realise that</p>

<p>I think this is a lesson that I have to learn to be more attentive. I need to pay more attention to details, and actually pause before answering the question.</p>
