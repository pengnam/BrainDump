<h2>General</h2>

<p>Ensuring that two values are 1 away from each other
abs(m-n)</p>

<p>if list is used at any time, always ask what happens if list is:
  1. Empty/Size 1
  2. Is increasing/decreasing continuously</p>

<p>In jump game, bounds are quickly surpassed when n=37. Nice to talk about possible integer bounds being surpassed. Python3.7 does not have a bound on its integer.</p>

<p>Think about the best case time complexity possible given the description of the problem.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about sorting</p>

<p>Steps:
1. Give a higher level idea of the solution
2. Give the expected time complexity</p>

<h2>Arrays and Strings</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array</a></p>

<p>Algorithms to consider:
KMP</p>

<p>ASCII character set is 128 characters</p>

<p>If you have to modify something inplace, try doing it from the back
Lists also support slicing assignment.</p>

<p>A[1:3] = &ldquo;Ab&rdquo;</p>

<p>!! When handling strings, remember that there exist upper case and lower case, and sometimes they are case insensitive</p>

<p>Nifty trick:
return min(string, &ldquo;.join(compressed), key=len)</p>

<p>Check if 1 substring is a subset of the other substring</p>

<p>Generating prefix arrays:
B = [0] * (N+1)
for i in range(N):
  B[i+1] = B[i] + A[i]</p>

<p>Good tips on monotonic queues:

<p>Medians: Use two heaps</p>

<h2>LinkedList</h2>

<p>Always check if you are removing from the start of the linkedlist (requires reassignment of head ptr)
Consider padding linkedlist with nodes infront (consider ctci sum lists, common ancestor)</p>

<p>Common ancestor of linkedlist and trees are similar</p>

<h2>Backtracking</h2>

<p>Be clear that its adding the piece at this position, checking if it works, and continue (in-place, so your helpers should not return the board but continue modifying the same board)</p>

<p>!! Backtracking should be done in-place</p>

<h2>Binary Search</h2>

<p>Binary search appears in funny places. If there is a bounds on the domains to search, try binary searching the value and applying some form of verifying algorithm</p>

<h2>Graph</h2>

<p>If need to do BFS, use a deque()
Ask if there are duplicates (!) esp. in bst</p>

<p>Preorder traversal of trees are not unique, but preorder traversal of trees where the None nodes are marked with a special character are unique</p>

<p>When analysing complexity of graphs (Not trees) , consider edges as well.</p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>Weaving two sets:
Use the first element from first set as prefix, recurse.
Use the first element from second set as prefix, recurse.</p>

<h2>Useful Problems:</h2>

<p>Reaching Points - work from the back instead of the front
Odd-even Jumps - monotonic stacks: finding the next index on your right that is your ceiling
Largest Window Area - monotonic deques: maintaing a sliding window of sorts</p>

<p>BinaryTreeCover - Recursion practice</p>
