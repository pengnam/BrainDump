<p>In servers, each incoming request is handled in its own goroutine. Request handlers often start additional goroutines to access backends such as databases and RPC services.</p>

<p>The set of gortouines need request specific values. Vontext packages makes it asy to pass request-scoped values, cancellation signals, deadlines to all goroutines.</p>

<pre><code>// A Context carries a deadline, cancelation signal, and request-scoped values
// across API boundaries. Its methods are safe for simultaneous use by multiple
// goroutines.
type Context interface {
    // Done returns a channel that is closed when this Context is canceled
    // or times out.
    Done() &lt;-chan struct{}

    // Err indicates why this context was canceled, after the Done channel
    // is closed.
    Err() error

    // Deadline returns the time when this Context will be canceled, if any.
    Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)

    // Value returns the value associated with key or nil if none.
    Value(key interface{}) interface{}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Done method returns a channel that acts as a cancellation signal on functions that run on behalf of context. When channel is closed, functions should abandon its work and return.</p>

<h2>Derived Contexts</h2>

<p>Functions used to derive new context values from existing ones.</p>

<p>WithCancel returns a copy of parent whose Done channel is closed as soon as parent.Done is closed.  CancelFunc cancels a context.</p>
