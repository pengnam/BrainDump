<h2>Git hooks</h2>

<p>Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at certain points in gitâ€™s execution.
$GIT_DIR/hooks/* (or <code>git config core.hooksPath</code>/*)</p>

<p>Before Git invokes a hook, it changes its working directory to either $GIT_DIR in a bare repository or the root of the working tree in a non-bare repository. An exception are hooks triggered during a push (pre-receive, update, post-receive, post-update, push-to-checkout) which are always executed in $GIT_DIR.</p>

<h3>Common hooks</h3>

<p>pre-commit: invoked before git commit</p>

<p>pre-push: invoked before push (can stop push)</p>

<h2>Git rebase</h2>

<p>git rebase: reapply all commits from current branch to tip of another branch.</p>

<p>Note:
- These commits are new commits, not identical to previous commits.
- <strong>Golden rule</strong>: Never rebase a branch shared by others</p>

<ul>
<li>If x number of people were working on that branch, and they have their own commits, <em>each person will have to create a new merge commit after the rebase</em>.</li>
</ul>
