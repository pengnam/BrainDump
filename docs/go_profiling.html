<p>Enable profiling to profile Go code.</p>

<h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>Computer performance will strongly affect the profiling of Go code. Modern CPUs rely heavily on active thermal management that can affect benchmark results.</p>

<p>The general method of deciphering the expected complexity is for the program to go loop finding.</p>

<h1>Profile</h1>

<p>A Profile is a collection of stack traces showing the call sequences that led to instances of a particular event such as allocation. Packages can create and maintain their profils, most common use is for tracking resources that must be explicity closed.</p>

<h1>pprof</h1>

<p>pprof operates on data in the profile.proto format. Each file is a collection of samples, where each sample is associated to a point in a location hierachy, one or more numeraic values, and a set of labels.</p>

<h1>Stack traces</h1>

<p>Stack traces at time of allocation: hence, might be for code that is not running anymore, which means functions to blame (for example, a function that frees memory space, is not the same as the function allocating the code)</p>

<h1>alloc_space vs inuse_space</h1>

<p>alloc_space: allocated memory and object counts
inuse: in-use memory and object counts</p>

<p>Inuse metrics are important in determining the amount of memory being used.
Allocations describe the performance/time spent on garbage collection</p>

<p>MemProfile rate records the fraction of memory allocations that are recorded and reported in the memory profile.</p>

<p>Types of profiles:
1. goroutine: stack traces of all current goroutines
2. help: sampling of heap allocation
3. threadcreate: stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads
4. block: stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives
5. mutex: stack traces of holders of contended mutexes</p>
