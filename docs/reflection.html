<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Reflection is the ability of a program to examine its own structure, especially through types as a form of metaprogramming.</p>

<p>GoLang is statically typed.</p>

<p>Consider interface, an important sub type.</p>

<p>Interface Variable can store any concrete value as long as value implements interface methods.</p>

<p>This implies that an empty interface is satisfied by any value, since any value has zero or more methods.</p>

<p>Go&rsquo;s interfaces are statically typed (all of them are), a variable of interface type always has the same static type.</p>

<p>Russ Cox has written a detailed blog post about the representation of interface values. Interface values store a pair, concrete value assigned to variable, and taht value&rsquo;s type descriptor.</p>

<p>Static type of interface determines what methods may be invoked with an interface variable, even though the concrete value inside may have a larger set of methods.</p>

<p>Empty interface will again contain that same pair.</p>

<p>Type assertion is needed for interfaces that do not inherit things that are of a direct subset of another.</p>

<h2>General idea of reflect package</h2>

<p>Implements run-time reflection, allowing program to manipulate objects with arbitrary types. Use: take a value with static type interface and extract its dynamic type information by calling &ldquo;TypeOf&rdquo;, which returns a Type</p>

<p>Reflection goes from interface value to reflection object, and refleciton object to interface value</p>
