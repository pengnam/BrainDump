<p><em>Reflections of my last day at work sent to a friend of mine.</em></p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>Last Friday was my last day.</p>

<p>Looking back, there was one particular question that stood out from my conversations throughout my internship and that was the question that you asked in the lift about how I felt about the internship. My response was &ldquo;It was not bad&rdquo;. But I don&rsquo;t think it truly properly explained my feelings at that moment. I should be more precise about it now in writing in hopes that I can be more precise about how I feel so as to do justice in giving a proper response.</p>

<p>Resolve</p>

<p>A person&rsquo;s resolve is weak. In part, the reason I replied &ldquo;not bad&rdquo; was because it is dangerous to call this place good.  We like to be comfortable and to settle when we find a place warm, intimate. A place that makes it easy to fall into a comfortable pace of life.</p>

<p>My resolve is weak. Our workplace feels pleasant to me. There is a part of me that wishes that this is what &ldquo;good&rdquo; really is and I should find a way to come back. To come back to a place that has coffee mornings and nice sunset afternoons. To come back to a place physically close to home, but culturally a distance away. To come back to a sense of familiar unfamiliarity with the people you meet and the work you do.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t think I really know what good is as my understanding of the world is shallow and fragile. If I believe this place is good my heart will yearn to settle. I&rsquo;ll end up chasing the shadow of our workplace at every turn and not be able to see better things.</p>

<p>However, the only thing that I can really say is that this place is not bad.</p>
